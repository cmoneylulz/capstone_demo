capstone continuous integration test
========

This repository contains a passing build of our capstone POI project that when configured correctly should automatically
build and deploy any changes using codeship and heroku.

NOTE: Currently not deployable due to heavy reliance on SQLite3. The database will need to be converted to postgress in order to function correctly.
